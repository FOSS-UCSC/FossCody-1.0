* Background/Target Group
* Drivers and pedestrians
* Existing Methods to Overcome the Issues Mentioned (if any)


# Proposed Solution
* Type of Solution (a mobile app/ desktop app/hardware system/hardware +software/hardware system + mobile app or any other)
	Mobile app
* Project Scope (Specify clearly what you will be doing in this project, including information about whether you are completely building a new solution or extending an existing system. If you are extending an existing system/design, the novel feature you are adding to the system should be properly specified and should be substantial as much as a new design)
* Novelty in your project (Eg: What are the drawbacks you are trying to address in the existing methods)
* Graphical illustration (flowchart/block diagram etc. as applicable) of the proposed solution
