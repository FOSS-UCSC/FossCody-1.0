Today many road accidents happens due to lot of ignorant and unaware drivers and pedestrians. Among them some of accidents happen in some unavoidable situations. As a example when vehicles travelling on a small mountain in narrow road. Both vehicles can not see each other. So if there some mechanism to avoid this lot of lives will be saved. 
* Background/Target Group
* Drivers and pedestrians
* Existing Methods to Overcome the Issues Mentioned (if any)


# Proposed Solution
* Type of Solution (a mobile app/ desktop app/hardware system/hardware +software/hardware system + mobile app or any other)
	Mobile app
* Project Scope (Specify clearly what you will be doing in this project, including information about whether you are completely building a new solution or extending an existing system. If you are extending an existing system/design, the novel feature you are adding to the system should be properly specified and should be substantial as much as a new design)
* Novelty in your project (Eg: What are the drawbacks you are trying to address in the existing methods)
* Graphical illustration (flowchart/block diagram etc. as applicable) of the proposed solution


# Tools and Technologies 
* Provide information about the resources you will be using for this project (as applicable to the type of solution you have stated).
  * Hardware platforms - devices, development boards etc.
  * Software platforms/tools


# Project Deliverables
* What are you planning to present at the final evaluations (clearly specify what functions/features of the proposed solution you are planning to present/demonstrate at the pilot competition evaluations).
